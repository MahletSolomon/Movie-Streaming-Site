# Movie-Lander
DSA final project

This is a website for streaming movies. It is made with react.js for the front end and Firebase for the back end. 

It fetches the movies by making calls to an Omdb API. Additionally, it tracks the watch history of the user and also had a playlist feature where movies can be added to playlists and removed once watched

The Firebase database tracks search histories, watch histories, and user playlists.
